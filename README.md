# Conics-Calculator
I am taking Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures, and since my college uses Java for these courses I've been switching to that, from Python. I didn't want to be stuck on syntactial stuff so I started learning before I start the course. Part of the interest was being able to construct Android apps so I installed Android Studio, and whipped this up in an afternoon. 

**Challenges**
Overall, Java hasn't been too bad (for a simple project like this). The only issue I ran into was trying to create the ability to output answer in radical form if the answer was not a perfect square, instead of a decmial. Other than that, though, this was more of a project to learn how to use Android Studio.
